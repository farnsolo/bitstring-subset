This Repository is focused on bitstrings and sets 


# Finding subset from bitstring (Bitstring-Subset.py):
Given a set and bitstring, the program will find the subset specified by the bitstring

Example:
Consider the set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Using the set U as above, find the subset specified by each
of the following bit strings:
1. 1111001111 = Subset = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10}
2. 0101111000 = Subset = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
3. 1000000001 = Subset = {1, 10}

NOTE: There is no exception handling in the program.

# Find difference between two bitstrings (Bitstring-Difference.py)
Write an algorithm that, given a finite set S = {s1, . . . , sn}, calculates
bX\Y where X ⊆ S and Y ⊆ S. Assume that bX and bY are given.
