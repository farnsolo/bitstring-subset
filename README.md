# bitstring-subset
Given a set and bitstring, the program will find the subset specified by the bitstring

Example:
Consider the set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Using the set U as above, find the subset specified by each
of the following bit strings:
1. 1111001111
2. 0101111000
3. 1000000001

1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10}
2. {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
3. {1, 10}

NOTE: There is no exception handling in the program.
